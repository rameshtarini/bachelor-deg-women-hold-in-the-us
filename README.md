# Bachelor Degrees Women Hold in the U.S.

As a female computer science and economics major, I have witnessed the lack of female representation in both my classes and the industry. Due to this lack of representation, I wanted to analyze and visualize the percent of bachelor degrees women hold in computer science and STEM overall. 

I utilized a CSV provided by the United States Department of Education Statistics and leveraged pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. 

If you open the Jupyter Notebook file you can see my python code as well as the below graphs I created.

# Nobel Prizes by Gender from 1901 to 2019  

To continue with the trend of female representation, I was curious to see the relation of Nobel Prizes won by women compared to men. Thus, I decided to employ pandas and Matplotlib to construct the pie chart below.
